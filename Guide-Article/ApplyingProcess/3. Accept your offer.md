# 3. Accept your offer

==Your university or college will contact you (usually via email) to tell you whether or not you have received an offer to study==. If you applied via UCAS it's easy to track the status of your application at any time.

If you are accepted with an [[Unconditional Offer]], then congratulations! You have a place and you can accept straightaway.

If you are accepted with a [[Conditional Offer]], the place is yours as long as you ==meet a few extra requirements==. This could be achieving certain exam grades or English language test scores.

For some courses you ==may be asked to come for an interview before you receive your offer==, either on the phone or sometimes in person. Check the course information before you apply to find out whether this is required.

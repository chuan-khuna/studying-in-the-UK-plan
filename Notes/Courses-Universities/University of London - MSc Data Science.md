# University of London - MSc Data Science

# Requirement

#### Entry routes

We offer two entry routes into the programmes, so if you do not meet the academic requirements you may still be eligible to apply through an alternative route.

#### Entry Route 1 (MSc/PGDip/PGCert) and individual modules

To be eligible to register for any of the Data Science programmes, you must have the following:

-   A bachelor’s degree (or an acceptable equivalent) in a relevant subject which is considered at least comparable to a UK second class honours degree, from an institution acceptable to the University.
-   Previous degrees should normally include a sufficient level of programming such as Python detailed in your transcript. Whilst other degrees such as Engineering and Mathematics will be considered on a case by case basis.
-   If we consider your previous degree as non-relevant then we will request you take our MOOC, [Foundations of Data Science: K-means Clustering in Python](https://london.ac.uk/courses/foundations-data-science "Data Science: K means clustering in Python"), before you start our Data Science programme. This MOOC requires approximately 30 hours of study.

#### Entry Route 2 (MSc/PGDip/PGCert) and individual modules

-   A bachelor’s degree (or an acceptable equivalent) in any subject which is considered at least comparable to a UK second class honours degree, from an institution acceptable to the University.
    
    In addition to the above, you will be required to complete an online preparatory course prior to registration. The online preparatory course, [Foundations of Data Science: K-Means Clustering in Python](https://london.ac.uk/courses/foundations-data-science "Foundations of data science: k means clustering in python"), requires approximately 30 hours of study.

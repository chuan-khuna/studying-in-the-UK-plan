# §Applying Process

- [[§British Council - Study in UK Process]]
	- [[1. Decide on a university or college and course]]
	- [[2. Register and apply]]
	- [[3. Accept your offer]]
	- [[4. Arrange funding]]
	- [[5. Apply for a visa]]
	- [[6. Prepare for your stay]]

# More details

- [[1. Decide on a university or college and course]]
	- [[Decide on Universities by Ranking]] (interested Universities)
	- [[Select the universities that we pass their requirement to apply]]
	- [[Choosing Supervisors]]
	- talk with your [[Supervisor]]s and then propose the [[Proposal|Research Proposal]]
	- then choose a university to apply by advisor and project

```
How to select a university to apply, from my understanding:

filter all_universities by your_interested_universities AND courses AND requirements AND project_and_supervisor

Q: Do I have to choose the advisor for a master degree university?
